# Wiring the Harness

Initially, I wanted to try to preserve as much of the original wiring as possible and try to design a "drop-in" solution for interfacing it
with and arduino and FS2020, but soon realized that the complexity and lack of technical documents/schmeatics meant I would never get around 
to completing it.
