# Wiring the Harness

Initially, I wanted to try to preserve as much of the original wiring as possible and try to design a "drop-in" solution for interfacing it
with and arduino and FS2020, but soon realized that the complexity and lack of technical documents/schmeatics meant I would never get around 
to completing it. 


Here are some images of wiring the gauges back to the card tray with some stranded 20 gauge white wire. I've tried to keep everything
as accurately labeled and neat as possible so I can eventually zip tie the cable bundles and make it look like a real (neat) airplane harness.

I also (eventually) want to design a custom PCB with edge connector that would slot into the exisiting card slot and can interface the arduino/arduinos with the instruments and hold all the motor drivers/voltage regulators, etc.
