# Throttle Quadrant

A really cool part of this machine is the near-to-life throttle quadrant that resembles something you'd find in a Piper Dakota cockpit. 
It consists of 3 linear potentiometers. To ensure that everything worked, I used a simple arduino code to determine the pot values 
(connected to analog pins) at min/max values and then wrote some code allowing the relative values to be displayed on a processing plot.

This is what they look like: 




And a screenshot of the processing plot:
