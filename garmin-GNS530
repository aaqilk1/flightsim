The ATC-710 had a really old style radio system on the top right side that I wanted to modify, since most of the electronics on the back 
were so tightly interconnected, it would have been a royal pain to try to assign arduino pins to each of the few available frequencies. 

Instead, I decided to design a mock-up (and slighly smaller) version of the Garmin GNS530 GPS Map so I could display map info on in the 
cockpit during IFR flights. I carefully measured the dimensions of the original radio panel and then created an equally sized bezel of
the GNS530 in Photoshop. This was then imported into Fusion360 and printed.
